![Image](https://i.ibb.co/zmktnG5/maxresdefault.jpg)

This is a simple example that shows how to integrate particles.js into a Flask web application.

### Project Structure

The project structure will look like this:

- templates
  - index.html
- static
  - css
    - styles.css
  - particles.json
  - particles.js

### Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Start the Flask development server:
   `flask run test_flask.py`

4. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to see the application in action.

5. The index.html file in the templates directory contains the HTML structure of the web page (Line 18). You can customize it according to your needs.

6. The particles.json file in the static directory contains the particles.js configuration. You can modify this file to change the appearance and behavior of the particles.

7. The styles.css file in the static/css directory contains the CSS styles for the web page. You can customize this file to change the visual styles of the page.

8. To update the background image in the index.html file:
   - Locate the following line in the index.html file:
   - Replace the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armM00/Backgrounds/main/nosignal.jpg with the desired URL of the background image you want to use.
   
9. Save the changes and refresh the web page to see the updated background image.

10. Customize the other aspects of the application as needed, such as adding additional HTML elements, modifying the CSS styles, or adjusting the particles.js configuration in the particles.json file.
